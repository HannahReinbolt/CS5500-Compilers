Instruction list before optimization is:
(0) x = 5  

Block leaders are as follows:
(0)


Blocks are as follows:
B0: (0) - (0)

Executing constantFolding for (0) - (0)
Executing algebraicSimplification for (0) - (0)
Executing commonSubexprElimination for (0) - (0)
(0) x = 5  

Eliminating temp vars that have constant value
(0) x = 5
