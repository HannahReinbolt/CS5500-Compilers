Instruction list before optimization is:
(0) a = 0  
(1) b = 1  
(2) c = 5  
(3) t1 = a + 0
(4) t2 = t1 + 1
(5) x = t2  

Block leaders are as follows:
(0)


Blocks are as follows:
B0: (0) - (5)

Executing constantFolding for (0) - (5)
Executing algebraicSimplification for (0) - (5)
Executing commonSubexprElimination for (0) - (5)
(0) a = 0  
(1) b = 1  
(2) c = 5  
(3) t1 = 0  
(4) t2 = t1 + 1
(5) x = t2
